## üéØ Target Variable

### Primary Target: Drug A Treatment Prediction

**TARGET**: Binary classification variable (0/1) indicating whether a patient received Drug A treatment within the critical 5-day window following symptom onset.

#### Target Variable Definition
- **`1` (Positive Class)**: Patient was **NOT** prescribed Drug A treatment (alert candidates requiring intervention)
- **`0` (Negative Class)**: Patient **WAS** prescribed Drug A treatment (no alert needed)

#### Clinical Context
Drug A is a time-sensitive therapeutic intervention that must be administered within 5 days of symptom onset to achieve optimal clinical outcomes. The target variable identifies patients who **should have received** Drug A but were **not prescribed** it, based on:

- **Patient Risk Factors**: Age, comorbidities, contraindications
- **Clinical Presentation**: Symptom patterns, severity indicators
- **Temporal Factors**: Time from symptom onset to diagnosis
- **Physician Characteristics**: Experience level, specialty, treatment patterns

#### Target Distribution
- **Class Balance**: Approximately balanced dataset for robust model training
- **Temporal Sensitivity**: Critical 5-day treatment window for Drug A efficacy
- **Clinical Relevance**: Directly impacts patient outcomes and treatment protocols

#### Model Objective
The machine learning model aims to identify patients who **missed** Drug A treatment to:
1. **Generate Clinical Alerts**: Flag patients who should have received Drug A but were not prescribed it
2. **Prevent Treatment Gaps**: Identify missed opportunities for timely intervention
3. **Improve Patient Outcomes**: Reduce under-treatment and improve clinical decision-making
4. **Support Quality Assurance**: Help physicians identify cases requiring immediate attention

## üîÑ Data Processing Workflow

The data pipeline follows a systematic approach to transform raw EMR data into machine learning-ready features:

1. **Raw Data Ingestion**: 
   - Import Excel files from `raw/` directory
   - Validate data integrity and completeness
   - Establish data lineage tracking

2. **Data Cleaning & Standardization**: 
   - Handle missing values using appropriate imputation strategies
   - Standardize data formats and encoding schemes
   - Remove duplicate records and validate referential integrity
   - Perform data type validation and conversion

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Calculate derived clinical features (age, risk scores)
   - Create temporal features (seasonality, time windows)
   - Generate risk indicators and clinical flags
   - Implement domain-specific transformations

4. **Model Preparation**:
   - Join tables using appropriate keys
   - Filter records based on clinical criteria
   - Create balanced datasets for training
   - Apply feature scaling and encoding

## üöÄ Usage Examples

### Loading Processed Data
```python
import pandas as pd

# Load processed data
patients = pd.read_csv('data/processed/dim_patient_cleaned.csv')
physicians = pd.read_csv('data/processed/dim_physician_cleaned.csv')
transactions = pd.read_csv('data/processed/fact_txn_cleaned.csv')

# Load model-ready dataset
model_data = pd.read_csv('data/model_ready/model_ready_dataset.csv')
```

### Data Exploration
```python
# Basic statistics
print(model_data.describe())

# Target distribution
print(model_data['TARGET'].value_counts())

# Missing values
