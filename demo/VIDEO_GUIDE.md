# Demo Videos

**Note**: Demo videos are actually located in the `../video/` directory.

This directory was created as a placeholder for future demo videos, but the current demonstration video is stored in the main `video/` folder.

## Video Guidelines

### Supported Formats
- **MP4** (recommended)
- **MOV**
- **WebM**

### File Size Recommendations
- Keep videos under **25MB** for optimal GitHub performance
- For larger videos, consider:
  - Compressing the video
  - Using external hosting (YouTube, Vimeo)
  - Using GitHub Releases for large files

### Naming Convention
- `demo.mp4` - Main system demonstration
- `api-demo.mp4` - API functionality demo
- `ui-demo.mp4` - User interface walkthrough
- `deployment-demo.mp4` - Deployment process demo
