# Video Access Issue Solutions

## Problem Analysis
- Video file size: 49MB
- GitHub file size limit: typically recommended <25MB
- Format: MOV format may not be fully supported by GitHub in some cases

## Solutions

### Solution 1: Compress Video (Recommended)
Use ffmpeg to compress the video to a smaller size:

```bash
# Install ffmpeg (if not already installed)
brew install ffmpeg

# Compress video to under 10MB
ffmpeg -i "Screen Recording 2025-10-21 at 16.31.11.mov" \
  -vcodec libx264 \
  -crf 28 \
  -preset medium \
  -vf "scale=1280:720" \
  -acodec aac \
  -b:a 128k \
  demo_compressed.mp4
```

### Solution 2: Create Thumbnail Video
Create a short video preview:

```bash
# Extract first 30 seconds as preview
ffmpeg -i "Screen Recording 2025-10-21 at 16.31.11.mov" \
  -t 30 \
  -vcodec libx264 \
  -crf 23 \
  -preset fast \
  -vf "scale=1280:720" \
  demo_preview.mp4
```

### Solution 3: Use External Video Hosting
1. **YouTube**: Upload to YouTube and embed link
2. **Vimeo**: Professional video hosting platform
3. **GitHub Releases**: Upload as release attachment

### Solution 4: Create GIF Animation
Convert key portions to GIF:

```bash
# Create GIF animation (first 10 seconds)
ffmpeg -i "Screen Recording 2025-10-21 at 16.31.11.mov" \
  -t 10 \
  -vf "fps=10,scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos,palettegen" \
  palette.png

ffmpeg -i "Screen Recording 2025-10-21 at 16.31.11.mov" \
  -i palette.png \
  -t 10 \
  -filter_complex "fps=10,scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos[x];[x][1:v]paletteuse" \
  demo_animation.gif
```

## Current Status
- ✅ Video file has been uploaded to GitHub
- ✅ README.md configured with download link
- ✅ HTML video tag has been added
- ⚠️ Due to file size, may need compression or alternative solution

## Recommendations
1. First try compressing video to <10MB
2. If still having issues, consider external hosting
3. Can create multiple versions: full version, preview version, GIF animation version
