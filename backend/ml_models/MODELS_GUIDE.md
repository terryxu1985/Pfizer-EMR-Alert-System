## üöÄ Model Integration Guide

### Loading Model Components

```python
import pickle
from pathlib import Path

# Canonical symlinks always point to the latest versioned artifacts
model_path = Path("backend/ml_models/models/xgboost_model.pkl")
preproc_path = Path("backend/ml_models/models/preprocessor.pkl")

# Load trained model
with open(model_path, 'rb') as f:
    model = pickle.load(f)

# Load preprocessing components
with open(preproc_path, 'rb') as f:
    preproc = pickle.load(f)

scaler = preproc['scaler']
encoders = preproc['label_encoders']
feature_columns = preproc['feature_columns']
```

### Generating Predictions

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

# Prepare input data (sample patient record)
input_data = pd.DataFrame({
    'PATIENT_AGE': [65],
    'PATIENT_GENDER': ['M'],
    'RISK_IMMUNO': [0],
    # ... include all 33 features
})

# Step 1: Encode categorical features using trained encoders
categorical_columns = list(encoders.keys())
for col in categorical_columns:
    if col in input_data.columns:
        # Handle missing values with 'Unknown' placeholder
        input_data[col] = input_data[col].fillna('Unknown').astype(str)
        
        # Map unseen categories to most frequent training class
        known_categories = set(encoders[col].classes_)
        input_data[col] = input_data[col].apply(
            lambda x: x if x in known_categories else encoders[col].classes_[0]
        )
        input_data[col] = encoders[col].transform(input_data[col])

# Step 2: Scale numerical features using fitted scaler
numerical_cols = [col for col in feature_columns if col not in categorical_columns]
scaled_data = input_data.copy()
if numerical_cols:
    scaled_data[numerical_cols] = scaler.transform(scaled_data[numerical_cols])

# Step 3: Ensure feature ordering matches training configuration
X = scaled_data[feature_columns]

# Generate predictions
prediction = model.predict(X)           # Binary class prediction (0 or 1)
probability = model.predict_proba(X)    # Probability estimates for each class

print(f"Treatment Recommendation: {'Yes' if prediction[0] else 'No'}")
print(f"Confidence - Not Treated: {probability[0][0]:.2%}")
print(f"Confidence - Treated: {probability[0][1]:.2%}")
```

## üîÑ Model Lifecycle Management

### Dynamic Model Selection Process
The system employs an automated model selection pipeline that:

1. **Evaluates Multiple Algorithms**: Compares XGBoost, Random Forest, Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting, and other candidates
2. **Applies Multi-Metric Selection**: Prioritizes models based on PR-AUC (primary), Recall, Precision, and composite scoring
3. **Automates Production Updates**: Seamlessly transitions winning models to production configuration
4. **Maintains Comprehensive Metadata**: Tracks version history, performance metrics, and artifact lineage

**Current Selection**: XGBoost was selected based on excellent PR-AUC (0.90), strong precision (0.88), and outstanding cross-validation stability (0.88 ¬± 0.01).

### Versioning & Artifact Management

- **Version Scheme**: Semantic versioning `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
  - **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to feature set or model architecture
  - **MINOR**: Performance improvements, new features (backward compatible)
  - **PATCH**: Bug fixes, minor refinements

- **Artifact Naming**: Timestamped snapshots (e.g., `_v2.1.0_20251021_120304.pkl`)
- **Symlink Strategy**: Canonical names (`xgboost_model.pkl`, `preprocessor.pkl`) link to active versions
- **Metadata Registry**: `model_metadata.pkl` maintains version‚Üíartifact mappings and performance benchmarks
- **Rollback Capability**: Revert to previous versions by updating symlinks or atomic file replacement
